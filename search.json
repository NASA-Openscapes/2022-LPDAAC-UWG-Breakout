    "text": "About\n\nWorkshop Goal\nThe goal of the workshop is expose ECOSTRESS data users to ECOSTRESS version 2 (v2) data products in the cloud. Learning objectives focus on how to find and access ECOSTRESS v2 data from Earthdata Cloud either by downloading or accessing the data on the cloud. The LP DAAC is the NASA archive for ECOSTRESS data products. ECOSTRESS v2 data products will hosted in the NASA Earthdata Cloud, hosted in AWS.\n\n\nWorkshop Description\nThe goal of the workshop is expose ECOSTRESS data users to ECOSTRESS version 2 data products in the cloud. Learning objectives focus on how to finda and access ECOSTRESS version 2 data from Earthdata Cloud either by downloading or accessing the data on the cloud. The LP DAAC is the NASA archive for ECOSTRESS data products. ECOSTRESS version 2 data products will hosted in the NASA Earthdata Cloud, hosted in AWS.\nThe workshop will demonstrate how to find, access, and download ECOSTRESS v2 data from the Earthdata Cloud. Participants will learn how to search for and download data from NASA’s Earthdata Search Client, a graphical user interface (GUI) for search, discovery, and download application for also EOSDIS data assets. Participants will also learn how to perform in-could data search, access, and processing routines where no data download is required, and data analysis can take place next to the data in the cloud.\n\n\nWorkshop Outcomes\nAt the end of the two days, participants should be able to find and access ECOSTRESS v2 data in the NASA Earthdata Cloud (hosted in AWS). Workshop materials will be available for future reference following the completion of the workshop/ECOSTRESS Science Team meeting\n\nNOTE: ECOSTRESS v2 data will only be available to approved individuals. Please work with Christine Lee (christine.m.lee@jpl.nasa.gov) to have your name added to the allowlist."
