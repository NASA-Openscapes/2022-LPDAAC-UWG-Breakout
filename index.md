## Welcome

![](img/lpdaac_hls_collage.jpg)

Welcome to the **2022 LP DAAC UWG Cloud Workshop** hosted by NASA’s Land Processes Distributed Activate Archive ([LP DAAC]( https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/)) with support from [NASA Openscapes](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/).

**The workshop will take place in-person (!) on May 26, 2022 from 8:30am - 12:00pm CDT [(UTC-5)](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/cdt)**.



## About

### Workshop Goal

The goal of the workshop is expose data users to working with NASA Earthdata cloud data assets from a work environment in the cloud (AWS us-west 2). Learning objectives focus on how to find and access data from Earthdata Cloud either by downloading or accessing the data on the cloud. 

### Workshop Description

The workshop will demonstrate how to find, access, and process data from the Earthdata Cloud. Participants will learn how to search for and download data from NASA’s Earthdata Search Client, a graphical user interface (GUI) for search, discovery, and download application for also EOSDIS data assets. Participants will also learn how to perform in-could data search, access, and processing routines where no data download is required, and data analysis can take place next to the data in the cloud. 

### Workshop Outcomes

At the end of the two days, participants should be familiar with finding and accessing data in NASA Earthdata Cloud (hosted in AWS). [Workshop materials](https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/2022-LPDAAC-UWG-Breakout) are available for future reference
